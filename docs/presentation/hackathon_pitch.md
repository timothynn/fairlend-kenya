**Team Members:** [Add team member names]  
**Category:** Financial Inclusion & Fair AI

## 🎯 The Problem

### Current State
Traditional credit scoring in Kenya has a **bias problem**:

- **Women** face 15-25% lower approval rates than men with similar profiles
- **Rural applicants** are 30% less likely to be approved than urban counterparts
- **MSMEs in the informal sector** represent 6+ million Kenyans but lack credit access
- **Historical data** perpetuates past discrimination

### Impact
- Financial exclusion reinforces inequality
- MSMEs can't grow without credit
- Kenya's financial inclusion goals at risk
- Regulatory compliance concerns for banks

### Why This Matters
The Central Bank of Kenya's vision for inclusive financial services cannot be achieved with biased AI systems. We need a solution that maintains risk assessment accuracy while eliminating discriminatory patterns.

## 💡 Our Solution: FairLend Kenya

**Generate fair synthetic training data that eliminates bias while preserving credit risk patterns.**

```

### Three-Stage Pipeline

1. **Bias Detection & Auditing**
   - Analyze existing credit data for disparate impact
   - Measure fairness across protected attributes (gender, location, sector)
   - Generate comprehensive bias reports

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Use Generative AI (CTGAN) to create realistic synthetic datasets
   - Apply fairness constraints during generation
   - Balance underrepresented groups
   - Maintain statistical properties needed for risk assessment

3. **Validation & Deployment**
   - Verify synthetic data quality (statistical similarity)
   - Test machine learning utility (predictive accuracy)
   - Validate fairness improvements (disparate impact ≥ 0.8)
   - Deploy for model training
