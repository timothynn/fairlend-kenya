# Technical Approach

## Architecture Overview
FairLend Kenya uses a three-stage pipeline for generating fair synthetic data:

1. **Bias Detection & Analysis**
   - Comprehensive analysis of existing credit data
   - Identification of disparate impact across protected attributes
   - Generation of bias audit reports

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data synthesis
   - Fairness constraints during generation
   - Balancing of underrepresented groups

3. **Validation & Deployment**
   - Statistical validation of synthetic data
   - Machine learning utility testing
   - Fairness metrics verification

## Key Technologies
- **Python 3.8+** for core implementation
- **PyTorch** for deep learning models
- **CTGAN** for tabular data generation
- **AI Fairness 360** for bias metrics
- **Streamlit** for demo application

## Kenyan Context Features
- M-Pesa transaction patterns
- SACCO membership data
- Regional economic indicators
- Informal sector characteristics
