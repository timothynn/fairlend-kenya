# Problem Statement: Bias in Credit Risk Assessment

## Context
The Central Bank of Kenya is focused on ensuring that AI systems used in the financial sector are fair, transparent, and inclusive. Traditional credit scoring models often perpetuate historical biases, disadvantaging certain demographic groups.

## Specific Problems Addressed

### 1. Bias in Historical Data
- Credit data reflects historical discrimination patterns
- Underrepresentation of women, rural communities, and MSMEs
- Limited data from informal sector participants

### 2. Regulatory Compliance
- Need for models that comply with CBK's fair lending guidelines
- Requirement for transparent and explainable AI decisions
- Accountability frameworks for AI-driven credit decisions

### 3. Financial Inclusion
- 6+ million Kenyans in informal sector lack credit histories
- MSMEs struggle to access credit due to biased scoring models
- Geographic disparities in credit access
